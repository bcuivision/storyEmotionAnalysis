My visualization supports the following tasks:
    - Story Selection (Users can select different stories to analyze)
    - Visualize the emotional journey of a story by analyzing each paragraph
        Opacity is proportional to the sentiment score percentage
        Circle size is proportional to the paragraph size (i.e. the number of sentences)
    - Paragraph Hover:
        When hovering over each paragraph circle, the exact sentiment scores will be displayed in the bottom right corner.
